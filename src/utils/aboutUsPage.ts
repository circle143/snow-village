      "Built for snowball fights, selfie sessions, igloo chills, and non-stop whoa moments—this is your escape from boring weekends and “same old” plans. Think real snow, freezing fun, and a whole village that’s straight out of your snow-globe fantasy (minus the packing and flights to Switzerland).",
      "Bring your gang, your date, your school group, or your inner child. We’ve got Yeti mascots, ice tunnels, Arctic vibes, and a whole lot of reasons to say “I’m coming back!”",
